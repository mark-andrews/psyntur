#' Visual versus Verbal Perception and Responses
#' 
#' An experiment studying the interaction between visual versus perception and visual versus verbal responses.
#' 
#' Subjects carried out two kinds of tasks. One task was visual (describing a
#' diagram), and the other was classed as verbal (reading and describing a
#' sentence sentences). They reported the results either by pointing (a "visual"
#' response), or speaking (a verbal response). Time to complete each task was
#' recorded in seconds.

#' Faithfulness from a Photo?
#'
#' Ratings from a facial photo and actual faithfulness.
#'
#' College students were asked to look at a photograph of an opposite-sex adult
#' face and to rate the person, on a scale from 1 (low) to 10 (high), for
#' attractiveness. They were also asked to rate trustworthiness, faithfulness,
#' and sexual dimorphism (i.e., how masculine a male face is and how feminine a
#' female face is). Overall, 68 students (34 males and 34 females) rated 170
#' faces (88 men and 82 women).

#' Age of Onset of Schizophrenia Data
#' 
#' 
#' Data on sex differences in the age of onset of schizophrenia.
#' 
#' 
#' A sex difference in the age of onset of schizophrenia was noted by Kraepelin
#' (1919). Subsequently epidemiological studies of the disorder have
#' consistently shown an earlier onset in men than in women. One model that has
#' been suggested to explain this observed difference is known as the subtype
#' model which postulates two type of schizophrenia, one characterised by early
#' onset, typical symptoms and poor premorbid competence, and the other by late
#' onset, atypical symptoms, and good premorbid competence.  The early onset
#' type is assumed to be largely a disorder of men and the late onset largely a
#' disorder of women.
